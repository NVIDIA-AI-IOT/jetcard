# JetCard

JetCard is a system configuration that makes it easy to get started with AI.  It comes pre-loaded with

* A Jupyter Lab server that starts on boot for easy web programming

* A script to display the Jetson's IP address (and other stats)
* The popular deep learning frameworks PyTorch and TensorFlow

After configuring your system using JetCard, you can get started prototyping AI projects from your web browser in Python.

If you find an issue, please [let us know](../..//issues)!

## Setup

Follow the steps below to download JetCard directly or create it from scratch.

### Option 1 - Download JetCard directly

1. Download a JetCard SD card image listed in below table onto a Windows, Linux or Mac *desktop machine*
2. Insert a 32GB+ SD card into the desktop machine
3. Using [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) select the downloaded zip file and flash it onto the SD card
4. Remove the SD card from the desktop machine

You may now insert the SD card into the Jetson Nano, power on, and enjoy the pre-configured system!

#### Latest Release (** **but not yet fully verified** ** )

> Please note, the password for the pre-built SD card is ``jetson``

| Platform | Board revision | JetPack Version | Download | MD5 Checksum | branch |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------- |------------- | ------ |
| Jetson Nano (4GB) | `A02` and `B01` | 4.5.1 |  [jetcard_nano-4gb-jp451.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MX-z7ZCPvUzpN3nGhfZMAgENtK6VnBdh) | 1004e73e034d6df3b5167705546a11f3 | [`jetpack_4.5.1`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetcard/tree/jetpack_4.5.1)

#### Old Release

> Please note that this image is only for the older `A02` revision of Jetson Nano board, which has only one camera (CSI) connector onboard.

| Platform | Board revision | JetPack Version | Download | MD5 Checksum | branch |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------- |------------- | ------ |
| Jetson Nano (4GB) | `A02` | 4.2|  [jetcard_v0p0p0.zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wXD1CwtxiH5Mz4uSmIZ76fd78zDQltW_) | f7b635a651e4a2228e3812360cce74e3 | [`jetpack_4.2`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetcard/tree/jetpack_4.2)

### Option 2 - Create JetCard from scratch

1. Flash Jetson Nano following the [Getting Started Guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit)

    > For Jetson TX2 / Xavier, use the [JetPack](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) SDK manager

2. On the Jetson, run the JetCard installation script

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetcard
    cd jetcard
    ./install.sh
    ```
    
Once the ``install.sh`` script finishes, your system should be configured identically to the SD card image mentioned above.

## Usage

### Connecting

Pick an option below and follow the instructions to begin web programming Jetson from a desktop computer using Jupyter Lab.

#### Option 1 - Ethernet / WiFi

1. Power on the Jetson platform configured using JetCard

2. Connect the Jetson to the same network as your desktop computer via Ethernet or WiFi

    > If you want to connect your Jetson to WiFi, but don't have a monitor and keyboard, you can connect via device mode (see below),       open a terminal, and then use the ``nmcli`` tool to connect to a WiFi network.  Find more details [below](#extras).
    
3. Determine the IP address ``jetson_ip_address``

    > If you have the PiOLED display attached, it will display on that screen.  Otherwise, you will need to connect a monitor, open a terminal, and read the IP using ``ifconfig``.
4. Connect to the Jetson platform from a desktop computer by navigating to ``http://<jetson_ip_address>:8888``
5. Sign in using the default password ``jetson``

#### Option 2 - USB device mode

If you do not occupy the Jetson Nano's micro USB port for power, you can use it to connect directly from a desktop PC!  The USB device mode IP address is ``192.168.55.1``

1. Power on the Jetson platform configured using JetCard

2. Connect the Jetson platform to the desktop computer via micro USB
3. On the desktop computer, navigate to ``http://192.168.55.1:8888`` from a web browser
4. Sign in using the default password ``jetson``

## Extras

### Connect to WiFi from terminal

To connect your Jetson to a WiFi network from a terminal, follow these steps

1. Re-scan available WiFi networks

    ```bash
    nmcli device wifi rescan
    ```

2. List available WiFi networks, and find the ``ssid_name`` of your network.

    ```bash
    nmcli device wifi list
    ```
3. Connect to a selected WiFi network

    ```bash
    nmcli device wifi connect <ssid_name> password <password>
    ```

### Create SD card snapshot

If you've applied modifications to the base SD card image that you want to re-use, do the following to create a compressed SD card image

1.  Remove the SD card from your Jetson Nano

2.  Insert the SD card into a Linux host computer
3.  Determine where the SD card is located using ``sudo fdisk -l``.  We'll assume this is at ``/dev/sdb``
4.  Copy the contents of the SD card to a file named ``jetcard_image.img``

    ```bash
    sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdb of=jetcard_image.img status=progress
    ```
5.  Compress the SD card image using zip

    ```bash
    zip jetcard_image.zip jetcard_image.img
    ```
